# winrt::event_revoker struct template (C++/WinRT)

When you register a delegate, you can request an event revoker object (also known as an auto revoker). You can manually revoke your delegate by calling the **event_revoker::revoke** member function on that object, or you can just allow it to go out of scope. For more info, and a code example, see [Revoke a registered delegate](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/handle-events#revoke-a-registered-delegate).

## Syntax
```cppwinrt
template <typename I>
struct event_revoker
```
