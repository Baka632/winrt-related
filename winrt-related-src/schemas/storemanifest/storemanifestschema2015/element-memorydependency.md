# MemoryDependency


Identifies the minimum memory that a device must have in order for your package to run properly.

For desktop devices, the value indicates the requirement for installed memory. Available memory is not considered.

For mobile devices, the value indicates the requirements for available memory. The equivalent requirements for installed memory on mobile devices are as follows:

-   300MB = device must have at least 1 GB of installed memory
-   750MB = device must have at least 2 GB of installed memory
-   1000MB = device must have at least 3 GB of installed memory
-   2000MB = device must have at least 4 GB of installed memory

For example, if you specify that your UWP app requires 300 MB to run properly, it will only be able to be installed on mobile devices with &gt;1 GB of RAM or on desktop devices with &gt;300 MB of RAM.
