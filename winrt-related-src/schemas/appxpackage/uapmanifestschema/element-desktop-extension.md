```syntax
<desktop:Extension Category       = "windows.fullTrustProcess" 
                   Executable?    = A string between 1 and 256 characters in length that must end with ".exe" and cannot contain these characters: <, >, :, ", |, ?, or *. It specifies the default executable for the extension. If not specified, the executable defined for the app is used.  If specified, the EntryPoint property is also used. If that EntryPoint property isn't specified, the EntryPoint defined for the app is used.
                   EntryPoint?    = A string between 1 and 256 characters in length, representing the  task handling the extension. This is normally the fully namespace-qualified name of a Windows Runtime type. If EntryPoint is not specified, the EntryPoint defined for the app is used instead.
                   RuntimeType?   = A string between 1 and 255 characters in length that cannot start or end with a period or contain these characters: <, >, :, ", /, \, |, ?, or *.
                   StartPage?     = A string between 1 and 256 characters in length that cannot contain these characters: <, >, :, ", |, ?, or *.
                   uap10:TrustLevel?   = String value. Can be one of the following: "appContainer", "mediumIL".
                   uap10:RuntimeBehavior?  = String value. Can be one of the following: "windowsApp", "packagedClassicApp", "win32App".
                   uap10:HostId?       = An alphanumeric string between 1 and 255 characters in length. Must begin with an alphabetic character.
                   uap10:Parameters?   = A string between 1 and 32767 characters in length with a non-whitespace character at its beginning and end. >
