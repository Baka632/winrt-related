| [uap:FileSavePicker](element-uap-filesavepicker.md) | Declares an app extensibility point of type **windows.fileSavePicker**. The app lets the user choose the file name, extension, and storage location for the specified types of files. |
| [uap:FileTypeAssociation](element-uap-filetypeassociation.md) | Declares an app extensibility point of type **windows.fileTypeAssociation**. A file type association indicates that the app is registered to handle files of the specified types. |
| [uap:MediaPlayback](element-uap-mediaplayback.md) | Declares an app extensibility point of type mediaPlayback so that your app can declare that it performs video transcoding. |
| [uap:Protocol](element-uap-protocol.md) | Declares an app extensibility point of type **windows.protocol**. A URI association indicates that the app is registered to handle URIs with the specified scheme. |
| [uap:ShareTarget](element-uap-sharetarget.md) | Declares an app extension point of type **windows.shareTarget**. The app can share the specified types of files. |
| [uap:VoipCall](element-uap-voipcall.md) | Declares an app extensibility point of type **windows.voipCall** so that your app can declare that it can perform an upgrade from a cellular call to a VoIP video call, and/or whether it is a VoIP app that supports dialing phone numbers directly. |
| [uap:WebAccountProvider](element-uap-webaccountprovider.md) | Declares an app extensibility point of type **windows.webAccountProvider**. | 

 

### Parent Elements

| Parent element | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| [Extensions (type:CT_ApplicationExtensions)](element-1-extensions.md) | Defines one or more extensibility points for the app. | 

## Remarks

For most types of extensions, Extension@ResourceGroup must match Application@ResourceGroup (if Application@ResourceGroup is omitted then Extension@ResourceGroup should be omitted also).

For a UI-based contract: if Extension@ResourceGroup is not specified then it will be implicitly grouped with the Application; if Extension@ResourceGroup does not match Application@ResourceGroup then the manifest will fail schema validation.

If Extension@ResourceGroup is not specified for a background task, or for a contract that is based on a background task, it will be associated with a default group for all background tasks. Background task contracts are allowed to specify the same values as Application@ResourceGroup.

For the following Extensions, Extension@ResourceGroup allows the background task that is run to be grouped into different processes which will be resource- and lifecycle-managed independently of other groups: windows.backgroundTasks, windows.appServices, windows.preinstalledConfigTask, and windows.updateTask.

For example, if the manifest had these three entries.

```XML
        <Extension Category="windows.backgroundTasks" EntryPoint="Fabrikam.BackgroundTask" ResourceGroup="Group1">
          <BackgroundTasks>
            <Task Type="timer"/>
          </BackgroundTasks>
        </Extension>
        <Extension Category="windows.backgroundTasks" EntryPoint="Fabrikam.BackgroundTask2" ResourceGroup="Group2">
          <BackgroundTasks>
            <Task Type="controlChannel"/>
          </BackgroundTasks>
        </Extension>
        <Extension Category="windows.backgroundTasks" EntryPoint="Fabrikam.BackgroundTask3" ResourceGroup="Group2">
          <BackgroundTasks>
            <Task Type="pushNotification"/>
          </BackgroundTasks>
        </Extension>
```

Then the last two background tasks would be activated into the same instance of backgroundtaskhost.exe if they were activated concurrently. However, a separate instance of backgroundtaskhost.exe would be spun up for the first entry because it has a different ResourceGroup.

If no ResourceGroup is specified for an extension then all background tasks are activated into the same instance of backgroundtaskhost.exe.

Additionally if one of these extensions(windows.backgroundTasks, windows.appServices, windows.preinstalledConfigTask, windows.updateTask) specifies the same value of the ResourceGroup attribute of the parent Application element they will be activated in the same process as the UI.

### Declarations

The following elements can be found in the declarations tab of the package designer - see descriptions for each of these elements:

**Search**: Registers the app as a search provider. The app's indexed content can appear as search results in the global search experience launched via the Search charm. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**CachedFileUpdater**: Registers the app as a cached file updater, allowing the app to provider updates to files that are accessed by other Microsoft Store apps. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**Camera Settings**: Enables the app to provide custom control panels for web camera devices. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**AccountPictureProvider**: Registers the app as an account pciture provider, allowing it to be launched in an account picture mode and to set the user's picture without additional prompting. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**PrintTaskSettings**: Enables the app to replace the basic print settings experience. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**LockScreen**: If a phone is locked, there is a limited amount of interaction that the user can perform. In some cases, a user would like to be able to answer a VoIP call without unlocking the phone. This contract makes that possible. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**Alarm**: An application can declare itself as the System Alarm App. When a user goes through the selection UI to set their System Alarm, only applications that are declared as System Alarm Apps can be selected. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**BackgroundTasks**: Background tasks enable applications to communicate with each other and enable one application to call another. In order to use contracts to provide or launch these background tasks, an application need to be declared as an app service. Multiple instances of this declaration are allowed in each app.
**Print3DWorkFlow**: Manufacturers of 3D printers can provide a Universal Windows app to provide a unique experience in the 3D print dialog. If they do not, Windows provides a default 3D printing experience. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
**PersonalAssistantLaunch**: Allows an app to integrate with Cortana. Only one instance of this declaration is allowed per app.
