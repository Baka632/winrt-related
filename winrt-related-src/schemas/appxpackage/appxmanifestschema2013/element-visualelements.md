<td><p>Describes the orientations in which the app would prefer to be shown for the best user experience. On a device that can be rotated, such as a tablet, the app will not be redrawn for orientations that are not specified here. For instance, if the app specifies only Landscape and LandscapeFlipped orientations, and the device is rotated to a Portrait orientation, the app will not rotate.</p>
<p>Note that on devices that can't be rotated, an app might be shown in that device's default orientation and the app's preferred orientation will be ignored. However, on a device with a rotation lock activated, your app's preferred rotation will still be honored.</p>
<p>These orientation preference choices apply to both the [<strong>splash screen</strong>](element-splashscreen.md) and the app UI when a new session is launched for your app. The preferences can be changed during run time through the [<strong>AutoRotationPreferences</strong>](/uwp/api/Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation) property.</p></td>

### Parent Elements

This outermost (document) element may not be contained by any other elements.

## Remarks

For more info about visual aspects for apps, see [**VisualElements**](../appxmanifestschema2010-v2/element-visualelements.md).

The manifest performs these semantic checks for **VisualElements**, which aren't enforced in the schema.

-   If [**DefaultTile\\Square310x310Logo**](element-defaulttile.md) is specified, **DefaultTile\\Wide310x150Logo** must also be specified.
-   If [**DefaultTile\\DefaultSize**](element-defaulttile.md) or [**ShowNameOnTiles**](element-shownameontiles.md) specify a certain image size value, that image size must have been declared in the manifest.
-   If [**LockScreen\\Notification**](../appxmanifestschema2010-v2/element-lockscreen.md) is set to **badgeAndTileText**, [**DefaultTile\\Wide310x150Logo**](element-defaulttile.md) must be specified.

**Square150x150Logo** and **Square30x30Logo** images can be given as either a direct path to an image file or as a resource. By using a resource reference, you can supply localized images to match different UI languages. For more info, see the [Globalization](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh831183(v=win.10)) topic.
