# Bundle manifest


## Purpose


The bundle manifest file is an XML document that contains a list of app packages and resource packages in the bundle.

The bundle manifest contains info about the architectures and resources of each package. When you install the bundle on a computer, you can use this info to determine the subset of packages that apply to that computer.

## Developer audience


Visual Studio and the [MakeAppx](/windows/win32/appxpkg/make-appx-package--makeappx-exe-) packaging utility automatically create and insert a bundle manifest schema (BundleManifest.xml) when they build each ZIP bundle.

## In this section
